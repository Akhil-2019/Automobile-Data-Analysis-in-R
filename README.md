Automobiles when launched in the market come with a fixed price with some additional costs in the form of Government taxes. The fixed price is assigned by the manufacturer by considering several features associated with the car like its engine, body-style, fuel type etc. Also manufacturer/brand value is also associated with the price of a car. However, these vehicles are built with keeping budget in mind with higher the budget, better will be the features, stronger the customer appeal and these factors contribute in deciding the price.

Also, every car and light commercial vehicle such as a small van, new or old, falls into a particular insurance group, which dictates to an extent how much it will be to insure. The risks associated with the vehicles are quantified using these groups by the insurers. Higher cost contributions are associated with higher group numbers. Cars are initially assigned these risk factor groups/symbols associated with its price which is adjusted accordingly based on the risk with higher the risk higher the factor. This process is termed as *"symboling"* by the actuarians. 

With symboling arises the questions of what factor influences the risk associated with a car and if these factors affect the price of a car in any way and if is there any way of predicting the price of the car by planning ahead on the features to be included. Answering these key questions is of utmost importance from the point of view of companies. With the motivation of answering these question, the objective is to analyze automobile data present in the UCI Machine Repository, which was collected from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook.
